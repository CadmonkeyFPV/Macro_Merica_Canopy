Tips:
I've printed this and the development versions in TPU with a 0.4mm nozzle and 0.2mm layer height.

I prefer Ninjatek Cheetah filament and a nice slow speed for best quality.

Holes for the heat set inserts are tapered and take a good amount of pressure and heat to get them set.

Other antennas can be used if desired. Either clip the model in your slicer to remove the triangular boss, or just cut off the extra material.

Step file is included if you wish to revise to your hardware choices.

Slot provided in the antenna tube for extra means of securing the antenna with a cable tie - why chance it with this VTX right?

Camera angle is fixed at 40° but the couplers can be revised for lower angles. 40° is pretty much the max before interference with the antenna tube.
